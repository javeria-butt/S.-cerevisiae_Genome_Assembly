# Glossary of Key Terms

A reference for key terminology used throughout this genome assembly project.

## 🏗️ Assembly Terms

* **Contig**
    A contiguous, gap-free sequence in an assembly—the basic unit produced by an assembler from sequencing reads.
* **Scaffold**
    One or more contigs joined by stretches of unknown sequence (represented as N's). Scaffolds are generated using additional long-range data (optical maps, Hi-C) and represent a higher level of assembly than contigs.
* **Unitig**
    The smallest unambiguous unit of an assembly graph. A unitig represents a path through the graph where there is no branching—every internal node has exactly one input and one output edge.
* **Assembly graph**
    A graph representation of the genome inferred from sequencing reads, showing sequences (nodes) and their overlaps (edges). The starting point for all assemblers.
* **GFA (Graphical Fragment Assembly)**
    A file format for representing assembly graphs, including sequences, nodes, and edges/overlaps. More information-rich than FASTA.

## 🧬 Haplotype & Phasing Terms

* **Haplotype**
    One copy of a chromosome in a diploid organism. Humans and most vertebrates have two copies (maternal and paternal) of each chromosome.
* **Phasing**
    The process of assigning assembled contigs or sequences to one specific haplotype (e.g., maternal vs. paternal). Well-phased assemblies separate the two haplotypes rather than mixing them.
* **Pseudohaplotype assembly**
    An assembly consisting of long phased blocks separated by regions where haplotypes cannot be distinguished. Represented by a primary + alternate assembly pair. Can suffer from "switch errors."
* **Primary assembly**
    The more complete of the two assemblies in a pseudohaplotype pair. Contains both homozygous regions and one copy of heterozygous regions. Used for most downstream analyses.
* **Alternate assembly**
    Contains only the alternate alleles (haplotigs) not represented in the primary assembly. Less complete than the primary.
* **Haplotig**
    A contig representing one specific haplotype at a heterozygous region. Found in the alternate assembly.
* **Switch error**
    An error in phased assemblies where the assembly switches between the two haplotypes mid-sequence, rather than staying on one haplotype throughout.

## 📡 Sequencing Technology Terms

* **HiFi reads (PacBio)**
    Long reads (10–25 kbp) produced by PacBio's SMRT sequencing with ≥99% accuracy (Q20). Combines the length advantage of long-read sequencing with the accuracy typical of short-read sequencing.
* **Ultra-long reads**
    Reads >100 kbp, typically from Oxford Nanopore Technology. Lower accuracy than HiFi but can span very complex repeat regions.
* **Hi-C**
    A sequencing method that captures the 3D organization of chromatin in the nucleus. Loci that are physically close in the nucleus are sequenced together, providing long-range linking information used for scaffolding.
* **Optical mapping (Bionano)**
    A technology that labels long DNA molecules at specific sequence motifs and images them, creating a physical restriction map of the genome. Provides very long-range structural information independent of sequencing.
* **SMRT sequencing**
    Single-Molecule Real-Time sequencing—PacBio's long-read sequencing technology. HiFi reads are produced using circular consensus sequencing (CCS) of SMRT reads.

## 📊 Assembly Quality Terms

* **N50**
    The contig/scaffold length at which ≥50% of the total assembly length is contained in contigs/scaffolds of that size or longer. A higher N50 indicates better contiguity.
* **NG50**
    Like N50, but calculated relative to the reference genome size rather than the assembly size. More meaningful for comparing assemblies of the same species.
* **BUSCO**
    Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs. A method for assessing assembly completeness by checking for the presence of genes expected to be in single copy in a given clade. Missing BUSCO genes may indicate incomplete assembly.
* **QV (Quality Value)**
    A Phred-scale measure of assembly base accuracy. QV30 = 99.9% accuracy, QV40 = 99.99%, QV50 = 99.999%. Calculated by Merqury using k-mer comparisons.
* **k-mer**
    A sequence of exactly *k* nucleotides. k-mer counting reveals the frequency distribution of all possible k-length substrings in the reads, which reflects genome properties.
* **Merqury**
    A reference-free assembly evaluation tool that uses k-mers from the raw reads to assess completeness and phasing quality of assemblies.

## ⚠️ Assembly Error Terms

* **False duplication**
    An assembly error where a genomic region is represented twice as separate sequences. Can be caused by haplotypic duplication or unresolved overlaps.
* **Haplotypic duplication**
    A type of false duplication where two haplotypes of a heterozygous region are both placed in the same assembly instead of being separated into two haplotype assemblies.
* **Misassembly**
    A structural error in genome reconstruction—sequences that are not adjacent in the real genome being placed next to each other in the assembly.
* **Missed join**
    The opposite of a misassembly—two sequences that are adjacent in the real genome but are not connected in the assembly. Identified and corrected during manual curation using Hi-C data.
* **Purging**
    The process of removing false duplications, collapsed repeats, and very-low-coverage regions from an assembly. Haplotigs removed from the primary assembly are typically added to the alternate assembly.

## 🧬 Genome Complexity Terms

* **Heterozygosity**
    The proportion of sites in the genome where the two haplotypes differ. High heterozygosity makes phasing harder and can cause assemblers to collapse or duplicate heterozygous regions.
* **Transposable elements (TEs)**
    Repetitive sequences that can occur at multiple locations throughout a genome ("interspersed repeats"). High TE content is strongly correlated with genome size and assembly difficulty.
* **Tandem repeats (TRs)**
    Repetitive sequences that appear in tandem at a single locus. Problematic for assembly when repeat unit length approaches read length.
* **Diploid**
    Having two copies of each chromosome (2n). Most vertebrates are diploid.
* **Ploidy**
    The number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell. Diploid = 2, triploid = 3, tetraploid = 4, etc.

## 🏗️ Scaffolding Terms

* **Contact map**
    A visual representation of Hi-C interaction frequencies between all pairs of genomic loci. Used to evaluate scaffolding quality—correctly assembled chromosomes appear as distinct triangular blocks along the diagonal.
* **YaHS**
    Yet Another Hi-C Scaffolding tool. Uses Hi-C contact information to order and orient contigs into chromosome-scale scaffolds without requiring a pre-specified chromosome number.
* **T2T (Telomere-to-Telomere)**
    A completely gapless chromosome assembly from one telomere to the other. The gold standard for genome assembly quality.
* **Manual curation**
    The process of manually reviewing and correcting an assembly based on raw supporting evidence (Hi-C contact maps, coverage tracks, repeat annotations) to resolve misassemblies and missed joins.
